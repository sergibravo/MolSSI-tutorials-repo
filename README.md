# MolSSI-tutorials
 Small projects made as part of the "Python Data and Scripting Workshop" by MolSSI.

The projects include:

- File parser: Scripts to open one or several .mdout files and parse the Etot values. An additional script to, furthermore, plot these values.

- Geom analysis: A script that takes an .xyz file (molecular geometry) and computes the distances between atoms within a molecule.
